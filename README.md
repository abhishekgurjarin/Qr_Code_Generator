# QR Code Generator Website

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll create a QR Code Generator web application using React. This project is ideal for those looking to learn about integrating APIs, managing state, and generating dynamic content.

## Project Overview

The QR Code Generator allows users to create QR codes by entering content, adjusting the size, and selecting a background color. It utilizes a public API to generate the QR codes and displays them on the screen. Users can generate, view, and download QR codes for various purposes.

## Features

- **Content Input**: Users can input the content they want to encode into a QR code.
- **Dynamic Size**: Adjust the size of the QR code dynamically.
- **Background Color Customization**: Choose a background color for the QR code.
- **API Integration**: Fetches QR codes from a public QR code generation API.
- **Download Option**: Allows users to download the generated QR code.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing component states.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For handling API requests and app logic.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
├── public
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── QrCode.jsx
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── App.css
